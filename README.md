This a successful attempt to make a WordPress theme that duplicates the http://ProBlogger.net front page information architecture.

Key features for the front page are:

* A feature post on top
* Recent posts stream on the left
* A central tabbed block with links to important content on the blog

This way the important content of your blog – and not just the last posts – are leveraged.

This is 2008 code that I gave up maintaining. But my blog – http://Avi.Alkalay.net – used it for a while. I'm releasing to the public to see if someone want to fork and improve it.
